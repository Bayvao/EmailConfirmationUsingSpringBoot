# EmailConfirmationUsingSpringBoot

In this project I implemented user registration with email confirmation. Basically, after the registration process, a new user is created behind the scenes. But the user cannot log into the application as the account is by default locked. To activate the user account we need a confirmation from the user. That is why we send a link to verify the registration process and activate the user account if the user clicks on the link.
